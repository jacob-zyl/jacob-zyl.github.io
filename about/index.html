	<h1>About Jacob?</h1>
	<p>It's a <em>beautiful journey</em>.</p>

  <p>Jacob became a fan of origami since very early years and kept exercising until now.
      He even tried to give paper roses to girls when he was a teenage though that did not work.
  </p>

  <p>Jacob loves reading.
      He was more into the universe of books instead of real life but this was reversed at a certain time point,
      maybe some later stage of his PhDhood.
  </p>

  <p>Jacob is a marathon runner, a cyclist, and a swimmer, though he never did sports before 12 years old.
      It's so funny that a person who loves sports could stay away from his passoion like forever,
      and one day, all of a sudden, he found it back from the dusty corner of his soul.
  </p>

  <p>Jaocb was dreaming to be a scientist like Steven Hawking, then he turned his goal to a great writer,
      but later he changed his dream to become a rocket scientist instead. Eventually he finished his PhD in Fluid Mechanics,
      focusing on Compuational Fluid Mechanics, which is usually called 'Rocket Science' as an idiom.
  </p>

  <p>Jacob loves writing code for computer from the moment he started writing them when he was freshman in university.
      He was not a good programmer but he kept writing code. This also pushed him to choose computational fluid mechanics as his focus on PhD
      because one can just write code all day in that position.
  </p>

  <p>After reading the first 3 chapters of SICP, Jacob finally felt he became a better programmer.
      But all those terrible code provide so many lessons before he eventually started reading SICP.
      Who knows how and where himself obtained his knowledge base?
  </p>

  <p>Jacob is good at cooking. His grandma is a fantastic home cook but his mom never cook anything delicious.
      Jacob contributes his cooking skill to memory of grandma's dishes and his solid knowledge on turbulence, convection, heat transfer,
      general organic chemistry, basic anatomy, and Gordon Ramsay.
