	<h1>About Jacob?</h1>
	<p>It's a <em>beautiful journey</em>.</p>

  <p>Jacob became a fan of origami since very early years and kept exercising until now.
      He even tried to give paper roses to girls when he was a teenage though that did not work.
  </p>

  <p>Jacob loves reading.
      He was more into the universe of books instead of real life but this was reversed at a certain time point,
      maybe some later stage of his PhDhood.
  </p>

  <p>Jacob is a marathon runner, a cyclist, and a swimmer, though he never did sports before 12 years old.
      It's so funny that a person who loves sports could stay away from his passoion like forever,
      and one day, all of a sudden, he found it back from the dusty corner of his soul.
  </p>

  <p>Jaocb was dreaming to be a scientist like Steven Hawking, then he turned his goal to a great writer,
      but later he changed his dream to become a rocket scientist instead. Eventually he finished his PhD in Fluid Mechanics,
      focusing on Compuational Fluid Mechanics, which is usually called 'Rocket Science' as an idiom.
