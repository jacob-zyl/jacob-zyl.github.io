* Purpose of the Site

This is my personal site where I post my reading notes, projects, and blogs.


** Code Structure

The file ~/css/main.css~ is for page style.

Directory ~/about/~, ~/blog/~, and ~/cv/~ is the content of the site.

File ~/blog/index.html~ is the format of index shown on the page. All
~index.html~ files serve the same purpose.

File ~/layout/default.html~ is the format of the default webpage, and
~/layout/post.html~ is the format of posts.

The ~kramdown~ shown in ~/_config.yml~ is a superset of markdown, just
use standard markdown is okay.
